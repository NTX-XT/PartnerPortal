#### 3.0 Select Partner & Allocate Opportunity

**Owner:** Channel/Partner Team (Lead), PS Overlay (Approval)

**Objectives:**
- Fair and transparent partner allocation
- Optimal customer-partner matching
- Balanced partner capacity utilization
- Quality-driven selection criteria

**Detailed Tasks:**

1. **Round Robin Allocation Model Application**
   - **Base Principle:** Fair rotation among qualified partners to ensure equitable opportunity distribution
   
   - **Allocation Pool Determination:**
     * Filter partners by certification tier required (based on complexity)
     * Filter by geographic coverage/timezone alignment
     * Filter by current capacity availability
     * Filter by technical specialization match (if required)
   
   - **Round Robin Mechanics:**
     * Eligible partners enter rotation queue based on last allocation date
     * Next available partner in queue receives opportunity offer
     * Partner has 24-48 hours to accept or decline
     * If declined: Move to next partner in queue, declining partner moves to end
     * If accepted: Partner exits queue until allocation complete, then re-enters at end
   
   - **Exceptions to Round Robin:**
     * Customer specifically requests known partner
     * Strategic account considerations
     * Specialized technical requirements match only one partner
     * Performance-based reallocation (see Quality Framework)

2. **Multi-Factor Partner Evaluation**
   
   - **Factor 1: Certification Tier & Capability Match**
     * Complexity score 1-2: Associate or Professional sufficient
     * Complexity score 3: Professional required
     * Complexity score 4-5: Professional or Expert required
     * Match partner's demonstrated capabilities to customer requirements
   
   - **Factor 2: Current Capacity/Availability**
     * Partner reports capacity monthly via dashboard
     * Formula: Available hours ÷ Estimated engagement hours = Capacity score
     * Minimum capacity score: 1.2x (20% buffer for scope adjustments)
     * Consider partner's current active engagements
     * Evaluate partner's proposed start date vs customer timeline
   
   - **Factor 3: Customer Preference & Relationship**
     * Customer has existing relationship with partner: +10 points
     * Customer specifically requests partner: Priority allocation
     * Customer previously worked with partner: Review past CSAT
     * Geographic/cultural alignment: +5 points
   
   - **Factor 4: Strategic Value & Net New ARR Contribution**
     * Partner's trailing 12-month Net New ARR: Tier adjustment
       - <$50K: Standard tier
       - $50K-$150K: High-value tier (+priority in rotation)
       - >$150K: Strategic tier (preferred allocation when qualified)
     * Partner's growth trajectory and investment in Nintex
     * Partner's market segment alignment with Nintex priorities
   
   - **Factor 5: Historical Delivery Quality & CSAT**
     * Average CSAT score:
       - ≥4.5: Excellent (priority allocation)
       - 4.0-4.49: Good (standard allocation)
       - 3.5-3.99: Acceptable (monitored allocation)
       - <3.5: Performance improvement plan required
     * On-time delivery rate:
       - ≥90%: Excellent
       - 80-89%: Good
       - 70-79%: Acceptable
       - <70%: Performance concern
     * Escalation history: Recent escalations = allocation hold pending resolution
   
   - **Scoring Matrix:**
     * Each factor weighted: Capability (30%), Capacity (25%), Quality (25%), Strategic (10%), Customer Preference (10%)
     * Minimum qualifying score: 70/100
     * Top-scoring partner(s) advanced to recommendation

3. **Channel Team Partner Recommendation**

     * Next steps and kickoff planning
   
   - Customer acceptance checkpoint:
     * Customer comfortable with partner assignment? → Proceed to Phase 4
     * Customer has concerns? → Sales and Channel Team address; may require alternate partner
     * Customer requests Nintex PS instead? → Escalate to PS leadership for capacity review

**Process Notes & Decisions:**

- **Q: What if the top-scoring partner declines the opportunity?**
  - A: Move to next-highest scoring partner. After 3 declines, reassess opportunity requirements or timeline.

- **Q: How do we balance Round Robin fairness with performance-based allocation?**
  - A: High-performing partners (≥4.5 CSAT) get preferential allocation within rotation; low-performing partners (<4.0) require approval for each allocation.

- **Q: What if customer doesn't want the assigned partner?**
  - A: Sales works with customer to understand concerns; if valid, provide alternative. Document reason for rotation adjustment.

- **Q: How do we prevent partner cherry-picking (only accepting easy/profitable engagements)?**
  - A: Pattern of excessive declines impacts partner standing; maintain decline rate metric (<20% acceptable).

- **Q: What happens if all eligible partners lack capacity?**
  - A: Options: (1) Extend customer timeline, (2) Split engagement across partners, (3) Escalate to Nintex PS, (4) Priority allocation bump for strategic partners.

**Success Metrics:**
- Partner allocation time (opportunity received to partner assigned)
- Partner acceptance rate
- Customer acceptance of partner assignment
- Allocation fairness (opportunities per partner over time)
- Quality correlation (allocation criteria vs delivery outcomes)

**Dependencies:**

- **Q: What if customer keeps requesting scope changes?**
  - A: Partner documents all change requests, submits to PS Overlay and Sales for customer approval and change order (additional cost/time). Emphasize change management discipline.

- **Q: How do we handle conflicts between partner and customer?**
  - A: PS Overlay serves as neutral mediator. Focus on facts, contract terms, and customer success. Escalate to Sales and Partner leadership if needed.

- **Q: What if partner identifies technical challenges they cannot solve?**

**Process Notes & Decisions:**

- **Q: How do we keep partners engaged during slow periods (low opportunity flow)?**
  - A: Provide continuous value through training, community, early roadmap access, marketing support. Consider "bench time" initiatives (contribute to methodology, mentor other partners).

- **Q: What if a partner stops performing after initial success?**
  - A: Investigate root cause (capacity overload, team changes, market distraction). Provide support and development plan. If performance doesn't improve, may need to reduce allocation or exit from program.

- **Q: How do we balance program standardization with partner autonomy/flexibility?**
  - A: Core quality standards and processes are non-negotiable. Partners have flexibility in approach, tools, team structure as long as outcomes are achieved.

- **Q: Should we cap the number of certified partners?**
  - A: No hard cap, but manage total partner count to ensure adequate utilization for each partner (target: ≥3 engagements per partner per year). If utilization drops too low, pause new partner recruitment.

- **Q: How do we handle partner requests for exclusivity in certain accounts or regions?**
  - A: Generally avoid exclusivity (limits customer choice and program flexibility). Consider for Strategic Partners in limited scenarios where significant investment and commitment warranted.

**Success Metrics:**
- Partner satisfaction score (semi-annual survey)
- Partner retention rate
- Partner utilization rate (% of available capacity utilized)
- Partner certification advancement rate
- Program operational efficiency (allocation time, approval cycle time)
- Innovation adoption rate (new tools, services, models)

**Dependencies:**
- Partner engagement and participation
- Nintex product team collaboration (roadmap sharing, training content)
- Marketing team support (co-marketing, materials)
- Technology team support (partner portal, tools development)
